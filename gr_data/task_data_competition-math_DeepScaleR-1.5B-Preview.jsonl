What is the sum of the two integers?\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, we're dealing with two negative integers that are consecutive. That means if one is, say, -a, the next one would be -a -1? Wait, no. Wait, actually, if they are consecutive negative integers, perhaps they are like -n and -(n+1), but maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to assign variables. Let me denote the two consecutive negative integers as x and x + 1. But since they are negative, let's think about it. If they are consecutive negative integers, maybe the first one is more negative than the second. For example, if the first integer is -n, then the next one would be -(n+1). But maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to let the two integers be n and n+1, but since they are negative, perhaps they are both negative numbers, so maybe n is negative, and n +1 is less negative? Wait, perhaps let's think of them as -k and -(k -1), where k is a positive integer.\n\nWait, perhaps let's approach it step by step.\n\nLet me denote the two consecutive negative integers as x and y, where x and y are integers, x < y < 0. Since they are consecutive, y = x +1. Wait, but since both are negative, if x is more negative than y, then y = x +1 would actually be less negative. Wait, maybe it's better to think that if x is the first integer, then y is x +1. But since both are negative, perhaps x is a negative integer, and y is x +1, which would be more positive? Wait, but that would be positive, but in the problem, both are negative integers. Hmm, perhaps I need to think again.\n\nWait, perhaps let's consider that the two consecutive negative integers are, for example, -a and -(a -1), where a is a positive integer. So, if a is positive, then -a and -(a -1) are negative integers, and they are consecutive because they differ by 1.\n\nTherefore, their product would be (-a)*(-(a -1)) = a*(a -1). And this product is given as 2550.\n\nSo, we can write the equation as:\n\na*(a -1) = 2550.\n\nSo, this simplifies to:\n\na^2 - a - 2550 = 0.\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation for a.\n\nLet's compute the discriminant first:\n\nD = (-1)^2 - 4*1*(-2550) = 1 + 10200 = 10201.\n\nHmm, what is sqrt(10201)? Let me compute that.\n\nWell, 100^2 is 10000, 101^2 is 10201. Yes, because 101*101=10201.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are:\n\na = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(10201)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 101]/2.\n\nSince a is positive, we take the positive solution:\n\na = (1 + 101)/2 = 102/2 = 51.\n\nTherefore, a = 51.\n\nTherefore, the two integers are -a = -51 and -(a -1) = -(51 -1) = -50.\n\nSo, the two integers are -51 and -50.\n\nTherefore, their sum is (-51) + (-50) = -101.\n\nLet me check this: (-51)*(-50) = 51*50 = 2550. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the sum is -101.\n\nWait, hold on, let me just re-examine the steps.\n\nWe had two consecutive negative integers. Let me denote them as n and n+1, but since they are negative, perhaps n is negative and n+1 is less negative. Wait, but if n is negative, n+1 is actually less negative. So, perhaps if we let the two integers be -k and -(k -1), where k is positive.\n\nThen, their product is (-k)*(-(k -1)) = k*(k -1) = 2550.\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, same equation, same result. So, same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the two integers are -51 and -50, sum is -101.\n\nHence, the answer is -101.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the two integers is \\boxed{-101}.", "reference_answer": "-101", "verifier_score": 1.0, "id": 37627, "metadata": {"question_license": "MIT", "question_source": "Hendryks/MATH"}, "community_score": {"answer": null, "question": 0}}

The question is: For how many positive integers \\( n \\) does \\( 1 + 2 + \\cdots + n \\) evenly divide \\( 6n \\)?\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to understand what exactly the problem is asking. It says that the sum \\( 1 + 2 + \\cdots + n \\) should evenly divide \\( 6n \\). That means when we divide \\( 6n \\) by the sum, the result should be an integer.\n\nI remember that the sum of the first \\( n \\) positive integers is given by the formula \\( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\). So, let's write that down:\n\nSum \\( S = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\).\n\nNow, the problem says that \\( S \\) should divide \\( 6n \\). In other words, \\( \\frac{6n}{S} \\) should be an integer. So, substituting \\( S \\) from above:\n\n\\( \\frac{6n}{\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}} \\) must be an integer.\n\nLet me simplify that expression. First, let's rewrite the division:\n\n\\( \\frac{6n}{\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}} = \\frac{6n \\times 2}{n(n + 1)} = \\frac{12n}{n(n + 1)} \\).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe \\( n \\) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, so we have:\n\n\\( \\frac{12}{n + 1} \\).\n\nTherefore, the condition is that \\( \\frac{12}{n + 1} \\) must be an integer. That means \\( n + 1 \\) must be a divisor of 12.\n\nSo, let's note that \\( n + 1 \\) divides 12. Therefore, \\( n + 1 \\) must be a positive integer that divides 12. Also, since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, \\( n + 1 \\) must be at least 2 (because \\( n \\geq 1 \\)).\n\nTherefore, we need to find all positive integers \\( m \\) such that \\( m = n + 1 \\) divides 12, where \\( m \\geq 2 \\). Then, each such \\( m \\) corresponds to a value of \\( n = m - 1 \\).\n\nSo, let's list all divisors of 12 first.\n\nThe positive divisors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nBut since \\( m = n + 1 \\geq 2 \\), we exclude \\( m = 1 \\). Therefore, the possible values of \\( m \\) are: 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nThus, corresponding \\( n \\) values are \\( m - 1 \\), so:\n\n- If \\( m = 2 \\), then \\( n = 1 \\)\n- If \\( m = 3 \\), then \\( n = 2 \\)\n- If \\( m = 4 \\), then \\( n = 3 \\)\n- If \\( m = 6 \\), then \\( n = 5 \\)\n- If \\( m = 12 \\), then \\( n = 11 \\)\n\nTherefore, the possible \\( n \\) values are 1, 2, 3, 5, 11.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with the absolute values, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it will make more sense.\n\nFirst, let's look at the innermost absolute value: |\u03c0 - 7|. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, which is less than 7. So \u03c0 - 7 would be a negative number because 3.1416 is less than 7. Therefore, the absolute value of a negative number is its positive counterpart. So, |\u03c0 - 7| should be equal to 7 - \u03c0.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n|\u03c0 - 7| = 7 - \u03c0\n\nBecause \u03c0 is about 3.14, so \u03c0 -7 is negative, hence absolute value flips it to positive.\n\nNow, plug this back into the original expression.

Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.14, 2\u03c0 is about 6.28. So 6.28 -7 is approximately -0.72. Therefore, this is negative. Hence, the absolute value will make it positive.\n\nTherefore, |2\u03c0 -7| = 7 -2\u03c0\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, let me verify.\n\nBecause 2\u03c0 is approximately 6.28, which is less than 7. So 2\u03c0 -7 is negative, so |2\u03c0 -7| is equal to 7 -2\u03c0. Wait, but I thought the previous step was |\u03c0 - (7 - \u03c0)| which is |2\u03c0 -7|, which is 7 -2\u03c0? Wait, no. Wait, let me recast it.\n\nWait, let's go step by step again.\n\nOriginal expression: |\u03c0 - |\u03c0 -7||.\n\nFirst step: compute |\u03c0 -7|. Since \u03c0 <7, this is 7 -\u03c0.\n\nSo now plug into the expression: |\u03c0 - (7 -\u03c0)|.\n\nCompute the inside: \u03c0 - (7 -\u03c0) = \u03c0 -7 + \u03c0 = 2\u03c0 -7.\n\nSo now the expression becomes |2\u03c0 -7|.\n\nNow, let's evaluate 2\u03c0 -7. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 2\u03c0 is about 6.2832. Therefore, 2\u03c0 -7 is approximately 6.2832 -7 = -0.7168, which is negative.

So, basically, if the denominator is zero and the numerator isn't zero there, then there's a vertical asymptote there.\n\nLet me write down the function again: y = (x\u00b2 + 2x + 8)/(x - 4). So, the denominator is (x - 4). To find vertical asymptotes, set denominator equal to zero and solve for x. That would be x - 4 = 0, so x = 4.

The homeowners want to cover the floor with rows of 6-inch by 6-inch tiles. They want to know how many tiles will be in each row. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since the room is square, that means all sides are equal. The area is given as 225 square feet. To find the length of each side, I can take the square root of the area. Let me write that down.\n\nArea = side\u00b2. So, if the area is 225, then the side is sqrt(225). Calculating that, sqrt(225) is 15. So each side of the room is 15 feet long. That makes sense because 15 times 15 is 225.\n\nNow, the tiles are 6-inch by 6-inch. I need to figure out how many of these tiles will fit along each row. But wait, the room's dimensions are in feet, and the tiles are in inches. I should convert everything to the same unit to avoid confusion. Let's convert feet to inches because the tile measurements are in inches.\n\nSince 1 foot is 12 inches, each side of the room is 15 feet, which is 15 * 12 inches. Let me compute that. 15 * 12 is 180 inches. So each side is 180 inches long.\n\nNow, each tile is 6 inches on each side. So to find out how many tiles fit along one side, we can divide the total length of the room in inches by the size of each tile.\n\nSo, number of tiles per row would be 180 inches / 6 inches per tile. Let me do that calculation. 180 divided by 6 is 30. So that suggests there will be 30 tiles in each row.\n\nWait, let me just verify this. Since each tile is 6 inches, and each side is 180 inches, then the number of tiles should be 180 / 6. Yes, that is 30. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if the area approach is correct. Since the room is 15 feet on each side, that's 15*12=180 inches on each side. So the total number of tiles along one side would be the length divided by tile length. Which is again 180 /6=30.\n\nSince it's a square room, each row should have the same number of tiles, so yes, 30 tiles per row.\n\nI think that's solid.

Hmm, I remember there's a distance formula for this kind of problem. Let me recall... I think it's something like the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in each coordinate. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, the distance formula is: distance = sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Let me write that down to make it clearer.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the coordinates of the two points. Let's denote the first point as (x1, y1) which is (-3, -4), and the second point as (x2, y2) which is (4, -5). \n\nAlright, so plugging these into the formula. Let's compute the differences first. \n\nCompute x2 - x1: that would be 4 - (-3). Wait, subtracting a negative is like adding, so that becomes 4 + 3, which is 7.\n\nThen compute y2 - y1: that's (-5) - (-4). Again, subtracting a negative is adding, so that becomes (-5) + 4, which is -1.\n\nNow, square both of these differences. So, (7)^2 is 49, and (-1)^2 is 1. \n\nAdd these squared differences: 49 + 1 is 50.\n\nThen take the square root of that sum: sqrt(50). Hmm, sqrt(50) can be simplified, right? Because 50 is 25*2, so sqrt(25*2) is sqrt(25)*sqrt(2) which is 5*sqrt(2). \n\nLet me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, x-coordinates: from -3 to 4. So, yes, 4 - (-3) is indeed 7.\n\nY-coordinates: from -4 to -5. Wait, hold on, is that correct? Wait, no, wait. Wait, hold on. Wait, the first point is (-3, -4), so y1 is -4, and the second point is (4, -5), so y2 is -5. So the difference is y2 - y1 is (-5) - (-4) which is (-5) + 4, which is -1. So that's correct.\n\nSo squared differences: 7 squared is 49, (-1) squared is 1. Sum is 50. Square root is sqrt(50) which is 5*sqrt(2). \n\nSo, the distance is 5*sqrt(2) units.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just make sure. Maybe draw a rough sketch to visualize.\n\nStarting at (-3, -4), moving to (4, -5). So moving from x = -3 to x = 4, that's a distance of 7 units to the right. And moving from y = -4 to y = -5, that's a distance of 1 unit down. So it's like a right triangle with legs 7 and 1. Therefore, distance is sqrt(7^2 +1^2) which is sqrt(49 +1)=sqrt(50)=5*sqrt(2).

There are three numbers, let's denote them as a, b, and c, where a \u2264 b \u2264 c because they are positive integers and presumably arranged in order. So a is the smallest, c is the largest, and b is the median.\n\nFirst, the arithmetic mean is 26. Since it's the mean of three numbers, that means (a + b + c)/3 = 26.

Hmm, perhaps.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nThe problem says: \"the median is 5 less than the largest number.\" So, that would mean:\n\nMedian = c - 5? Wait, no. Wait, let's see. The median is 27, and this is 5 less than the largest number. So, largest number is 27 +5 =32. So yes, c =32.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, perhaps the wording is that the median is 5 less than the largest number. So if the median is 27, then the largest number is 27 +5=32. So yes, c=32.\n\nSo now, let's summarize:\n\nWe have three numbers: a, b, c.\n\nThey are positive integers, so a, b, c are positive integers, and a \u2264 b \u2264 c.\n\nGiven:\n\n1. Mean is 26: (a + b + c)/3 =26 \u21d2 a + b + c =78.\n\n2. Median is 27: since it's the middle number, b=27.\n\n3. Median is 5 less than the largest number: so b = c -5 \u21d2 c = b +5 =27 +5=32.\n\nSo now, we know that b=27, c=32.\n\nNow, plug these into the sum equation:\n\na + b + c =78 \u21d2 a +27 +32=78 \u21d2 a +59=78 \u21d2 a=78-59=19.\n\nTherefore, the three numbers are 19,27,32. So the smallest number is a=19.\n\nWait, let me verify that. So if a=19, b=27, c=32. Then the mean is (19+27+32)/3=(78)/3=26, which is correct. The median is 27, which is correct.

Maybe it's better to try to figure out the dimensions step by step.\n\nFirst, since all five rectangles are identical, each has the same length and width. Let's denote the length as L and the width as W. Since they are arranged to form a larger rectangle, I need to figure out how they are arranged.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, the outer rectangle PQRS is drawn with points S at (0,0), R at (2x,0), Q at (3w, x + w), and P at (0, x + w). Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the outer rectangle has length 3w and width x + w? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think differently.\n\nSince there are five identical rectangles, perhaps the arrangement is such that two rectangles are placed horizontally on the bottom, and the third is on top, making a sort of L-shape but with five rectangles. Alternatively, maybe it's arranged in a 2x2 grid with one extra rectangle, but that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the larger rectangle is formed by combining the five smaller rectangles in some way. Let's try to figure out the possible dimensions.\n\nGiven that all five rectangles are identical, their sides must fit together in such a way that the larger rectangle's length and width can be expressed in terms of x and W, perhaps.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, it mentions that w is defined as 2/3, but perhaps that's specific to the drawing. Maybe I should try to assign variables.\n\nLet me denote each small rectangle as having length L and width W. Now, since they are arranged to form a larger rectangle, perhaps the arrangement is such that the larger rectangle has a length that is a multiple of L or W, and the same for the width.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, the outer rectangle seems to have coordinates: S at (0,0), R at (2x,0), Q at (3w, x + w), and P at (0, x + w). Hmm, perhaps the outer rectangle has length 3w and width x + w? But wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the larger rectangle is formed by two rows: the first row has two rectangles, and the second row has three? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the larger rectangle has length equal to 2x + something and width equal to x + something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let's think of the Asymptote code. It defines x as a variable, and w is 2/3 of x. Maybe w is 2/3 x.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nreal x = 1; real w = 2/3;\n\nThen it draws the outer rectangle with points s=(0,0), r=(2x,0), q=(3w, x + w), p=(0, x + w). So, the outer rectangle has length from (0,0) to (2x,0), so that's 2x in length. The width is from y=0 to y=x + w, so that's x + w in height.\n\nBut since it's a rectangle, the opposite sides should be equal. Wait, perhaps the outer rectangle's length is 2x, and its height is x + w. But maybe the inner rectangles have dimensions related to x and w.\n\nLooking at the code, it draws several internal lines:\n\n- draw((x,0)--(x,w));\n- draw((0,w)--(2x,w));\n- draw((w, x + w)--(w, w));\n- draw((2w, x + w)--(2w, w));\n\nSo perhaps the inner lines divide the larger rectangle into smaller sections. Maybe the larger rectangle is divided into smaller rectangles, each of which is identical.\n\nSo, perhaps the larger rectangle is divided into two parts: a bottom part with two rectangles and a top part with three? Or maybe the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each small rectangle has dimensions x by something else.\n\nWait, perhaps let's try to figure out the possible arrangement.\n\nSince all five rectangles are identical, their sides must fit together in some way. Let's suppose that each small rectangle has length L and width W. Then, depending on how they are arranged, the larger rectangle's length and width can be expressed in terms of L and W.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, perhaps the outer rectangle has a width of x + w and a length of 3w? Wait, perhaps I need to find expressions for L and W in terms of x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to assign variables.\n\nLet me denote each small rectangle as having length 'a' and width 'b'. Then, depending on the arrangement, the larger rectangle's dimensions can be expressed as:\n\nSuppose the larger rectangle has length (a + b) and width (something). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the Asymptote code's coordinates.\n\nLooking at the coordinates:\n\n- S is at (0,0)\n- R is at (2x, 0)\n- Q is at (3w, x + w)\n- P is at (0, x + w)\n\nSo, the outer rectangle has width from x=0 to x=2x, so width is 2x. The height is from y=0 to y=x + w, so height is x + w.\n\nTherefore, the area of the larger rectangle is width * height = 2x * (x + w) = 4000.\n\nBut wait, since all five rectangles are identical, perhaps the area of each small rectangle is (a*b), and five of them make up the larger rectangle's area. Therefore, 5ab = 4000, so ab = 800.\n\nBut perhaps we need more information about the arrangement.\n\nLooking back at the Asymptote code, it draws several internal lines:\n\n1. draw((x,0)--(x,w)); This draws a vertical line from (x,0) to (x,w).\n2. draw((0,w)--(2x,w)); This draws a horizontal line from (0,w) to (2x,w).\n3. draw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); This draws a vertical line from (w, x + w) down to (w, w).\n4. draw((2w, x + w)--(2w, w)); This draws another vertical line from (2w, x + w) down to (2w, w).\n\nSo perhaps these lines divide the larger rectangle into smaller regions, each of which is a small rectangle.\n\nFrom this, perhaps we can figure out the dimensions of each small rectangle.\n\nGiven that, perhaps let's think about the structure.\n\nLooking at the outer rectangle, which is from (0,0) to (2x,0) to (2x, x + w) to (0, x + w). Wait, no. Actually, the outer rectangle is from (0,0) to (2x,0) to (3w, x + w) to (0, x + w). Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps let's think of the outer rectangle as having length 2x and height x + w. Then, since it's made up of five identical rectangles, perhaps the area is 5*(a*b) = 4000.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to see how the internal lines divide the rectangle.\n\nLooking at the internal lines:\n\n- There's a vertical line at x, from y=0 to y=w.\n- A horizontal line from (0,w) to (2x, w).\n- Vertical lines at w and 2w, from y=x + w down to y=w.\n\nThis suggests that the larger rectangle is divided into smaller regions, some of which are small rectangles.\n\nPerhaps, in terms of the variables, let's consider the width of each small rectangle. If each small rectangle has width b, then perhaps the length is a.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, perhaps the horizontal lines are at y=0, y=w, y=2w, etc., but perhaps it's better to think step by step.\n\nLet me try to assign variables.\n\nLet each small rectangle have length L and width W. Since they are identical, all have the same L and W.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, perhaps the outer rectangle has length 2x and height x + w, but perhaps w is related to x.\n\nGiven that w is defined as 2/3 in the code, perhaps in the problem, w is 2/3 x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let's consider the arrangement. If the larger rectangle is formed by five small rectangles, perhaps arranged in a way that two rectangles are placed horizontally on the bottom, and three on top, making a total of five.\n\nIf that's the case, perhaps the length of the larger rectangle is equal to the length of the small rectangles plus something, and the height is the width of the small rectangles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each small rectangle has dimensions x by something else.\n\nWait, perhaps let's think of the larger rectangle's length and width in terms of x.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, perhaps the outer rectangle has length 2x and height x + w. But perhaps in the problem, since all five rectangles are arranged, perhaps the length of the larger rectangle is 3x, and the width is something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let's think about the number of rows and columns.\n\nSince there are five rectangles, perhaps arranged in two rows: the first row has two rectangles, and the second row has three? Or maybe the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the Asymptote code's coordinates. The outer rectangle goes from (0,0) to (2x,0) to (3w, x + w) to (0, x + w). Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps let's try to figure out the relationships between the variables.\n\nFrom the Asymptote code, we have:\n\n- x is defined as a variable.\n- w is defined as 2/3 of x.\n\nSo perhaps w = (2/3)x.\n\nThen, perhaps in the larger rectangle, the height is x + w = x + (2/3)x = (5/3)x.\n\nAnd the width is 2x.\n\nTherefore, the area of the larger rectangle is width * height = 2x * (5/3)x = (10/3)x\u00b2.\n\nGiven that the area is 4000, so:\n\n(10/3)x\u00b2 = 4000\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 = (4000 * 3)/10 = (12000)/10 = 1200\n\nTherefore, x = sqrt(1200) \u2248 sqrt(1200) \u2248 34.641, which rounds to 35.\n\nWait, but let's verify this because perhaps my initial assumption about the dimensions is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let's think differently.\n\nSince the Asymptote code defines x and w as variables, perhaps the problem is such that the larger rectangle's dimensions are related to x and w, and we need to relate them through the arrangement.\n\nGiven that all five rectangles are identical, perhaps the ratio between their length and width can be determined.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, perhaps the larger rectangle's length is 3w and the width is x + w.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of variables.\n\nLet me denote that each small rectangle has length L and width W.\n\nSince all five rectangles are arranged to form the larger rectangle, perhaps the larger rectangle's length is 2L and the width is 3W, or something like that.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to find expressions for L and W in terms of x.\n\nGiven that the area of the larger rectangle is 4000, which is 5 times the area of each small rectangle. Therefore, each small rectangle has area 800.\n\nTherefore, L * W = 800.\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between L and W in terms of x.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, perhaps the larger rectangle is divided into rows and columns. For example, perhaps the larger rectangle is divided into two rows: the first row has two small rectangles, and the second row has three. Therefore, perhaps the height of the larger rectangle is equal to the sum of the heights of two small rectangles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to assign variables based on the Asymptote code.\n\nFrom the Asymptote code:\n\n- The outer rectangle is from (0,0) to (2x,0) to (3w, x + w) to (0, x + w).\n\nTherefore, the width is 2x and the height is x + w.\n\nThus, area is 2x*(x + w) = 4000.\n\nBut since all five rectangles are identical, perhaps each small rectangle has dimensions x by something.\n\nLooking at the internal lines:\n\n- There is a vertical line at x, from y=0 to y=w.\n\n- A horizontal line from (0,w) to (2x, w).\n\n- Vertical lines at w and 2w, from y=x + w down to y=w.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the larger rectangle is divided into smaller rectangles where each small rectangle has width x and height w.\n\nBut perhaps each small rectangle has dimensions x by w.\n\nTherefore, since there are five of them, perhaps the area is 5*x*w = 4000.\n\nBut wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the larger rectangle is divided into five smaller rectangles arranged in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the arrangement as follows:\n\nThe larger rectangle has a length of 3x and a width of something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the larger rectangle as having dimensions (2x + w) by (something). Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider the Asymptote code's coordinate definitions.\n\nFrom the Asymptote code:\n\n- The outer rectangle is defined with points s=(0,0), r=(2x,0), q=(3w, x + w), p=(0, x + w).\n\nTherefore, the width of the outer rectangle is from x=0 to x=2x, so width is 2x.\n\nThe height is from y=0 to y=x + w, so height is x + w.\n\nTherefore, area is 2x*(x + w) = 4000.\n\nNow, since all five rectangles are identical, perhaps each small rectangle has dimensions x by (x + w)/something.\n\nWait, perhaps let's think about how the larger rectangle is divided.\n\nGiven the Asymptote code, perhaps the larger rectangle is divided into two parts vertically and three parts horizontally, but perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the larger rectangle has a width of 3x and a height of something.\n\nWait, perhaps let's think of the larger rectangle's length as being composed of two segments: one of length x and another of length something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the larger rectangle as being divided into a grid of 2 rows and 3 columns, but perhaps each cell is a small rectangle.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too convoluted.\n\nGiven that, perhaps let's go back to the area.\n\nWe have that the area is 2x*(x + w) = 4000.\n\nBut perhaps we need another equation to relate x and w.\n\nLooking at the internal lines in the Asymptote code:\n\n- There's a vertical line at x, from (x,0) to (x, w).\n\n- A horizontal line from (0, w) to (2x, w).\n\n- Vertical lines at w and 2w from (w, x + w) down to (w, w) and (2w, x + w) down to (2w, w).\n\nThis suggests that the larger rectangle is divided into several regions, each of which is a small rectangle.\n\nPerhaps each small rectangle has dimensions x by something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the width of the larger rectangle is 2x, and the height is x + w, and since the area is 4000, then:\n\n2x*(x + w) = 4000.\n\nBut perhaps we need another equation to relate x and w.\n\nLooking at the internal lines, perhaps the height of each small rectangle is w.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the height of the larger rectangle is x + w, which is equal to 2w, perhaps? Because perhaps there are two layers of small rectangles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since the internal lines go from y=w to y=2w, perhaps each small rectangle has height w.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the height of the larger rectangle is x + w, which is equal to 2w, since there are two layers of small rectangles.\n\nTherefore, x + w = 2w => x = w.\n\nBut in the Asymptote code, w is defined as 2/3 x, which would imply that if x = w, then w = 2/3 x, which would mean x = 2/3 x, which is only possible if x=0, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, perhaps this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think that the height of the larger rectangle is x + w, and perhaps the width is 3x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the larger rectangle as having length 3x and width x + w.\n\nTherefore, area is 3x*(x + w) = 4000.\n\nBut perhaps we need another equation.\n\nLooking at the internal lines, perhaps the horizontal line from (0,w) to (2x, w) divides the larger rectangle into two parts: one from y=0 to y=w, and another from y=w to y=x + w.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the height of the first part is w, and the height of the second part is x + w - w = x.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the larger rectangle is divided into two regions: one of height w and another of height x.\n\nIf the five small rectangles are arranged such that one part is a single row of rectangles and the other part is another row, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since the larger rectangle is divided into two parts vertically, each part containing a certain number of small rectangles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think that the larger rectangle is divided into two rows: the first row has two small rectangles, and the second row has three.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the height of the larger rectangle is equal to the sum of the heights of the two rows.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the height is w + something.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too convoluted without a clear figure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let's consider that each small rectangle has dimensions x by (x + w). Therefore, since there are five of them, perhaps the area is 5*x*(x + w) = 4000.\n\nBut perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think that the larger rectangle's length is 3x and the height is x + w.\n\nTherefore, area is 3x*(x + w) = 4000.\n\nNow, perhaps looking at the internal lines, perhaps the width of the larger rectangle is 2x, and the height is x + w.\n\nTherefore, 2x*(x + w) = 4000.\n\nBut perhaps from the Asymptote code, since w is defined as 2/3 x, perhaps we can substitute that.\n\nGiven that w = (2/3)x.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the area equation:\n\n2x*(x + (2/3)x) = 2x*( (5/3)x ) = 2x*(5x/3) = (10/3)x\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, 10/3 x\u00b2 = 4000.\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 = (4000 * 3)/10 = 1200.\n\nTherefore, x = sqrt(1200) \u2248 sqrt(1200) \u2248 34.641, which rounds to 35.\n\nTherefore, the length x is approximately 35.\n\nThus, the answer is 35.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{35}", "reference_answer": "35", "verifier_score": 1.0, "id": 36411, "metadata": {"question_license": "MIT", "question_source": "Hendryks/MATH"}, "community_score": {"answer": null, "question": 0}}
{"question": "What is the largest four-digit number that is divisible by 4?", "answer_content": "To find the largest four-digit number that is divisible by 4, we start by noting that the largest four-digit number is 9999. However, we need to check if this number is divisible by 4.\n\nA number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4. The last two digits of 9999 are 99. Checking if 99 is divisible by 4, we find that 99 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 3. Therefore, 9999 is not divisible by 4.\n\nTo find the next lower number, we subtract the remainder when 9999 is divided by 4. Since 9999 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 3, we subtract 3 from 9999 to get 9996.\n\nWe verify that 9996 is divisible by 4 by checking its last two digits, which are 96. Since 96 is divisible by 4, 9996 is indeed divisible by 4.\n\nThus, the largest four-digit number that is divisible by 4 is \\(\\boxed{9996}\\).", "reasoning_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the largest four-digit number that's divisible by 4. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, what exactly is a four-digit number? Well, four-digit numbers range from 1000 up to 9999. So, the largest four-digit number is 9999. But wait, is 9999 divisible by 4? I don't know yet. Maybe I should figure out how to determine if a number is divisible by 4.\n\nI remember that a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. So, for example, 1234 is divisible by 4 because 34 divided by 4 is 8.5, which isn't an integer, but wait, actually, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, no, actually, it's the last two digits, so in this case, the last two digits are 34, and 34 divided by 4 is 8.5, which is not an integer. So, does that mean 1234 is not divisible by 4? But wait, actually, maybe I should check that. Wait, maybe my initial thought was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just think about the four-digit number. The largest four-digit number is 9999. Let's see if that's divisible by 4. To check that, we can divide 9999 by 4 and see if the remainder is zero. Let's compute that.\n\nSo, 9999 divided by 4. Let me compute this step by step. 4 goes into 9 two times with a remainder of 1. Then bring down the next digit: 19. 4 goes into 19 four times (4*4=16), remainder 3. Bring down the next digit: 9. Now, we have 39. 4 goes into 39 nine times (4*9=36), remainder 3. Bring down the last digit: 9. So now, we have 39 again. Wait, maybe this isn't the best way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if the last two digits, 99, are divisible by 4. Wait, no, wait. The last two digits of 9999 are 99. Wait, no. Wait, 9999 is 9999, so the last two digits are 99? Wait, no, the last two digits of 9999 are 99? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, 9999 is actually four digits: thousands, hundreds, tens, ones. So, let me think.\n\nNo, actually, wait, perhaps I'm confusing. Wait, 9999 is the number. The last two digits are 99? Wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, let's think in terms of place value.\n\nEach digit in a number has a place value. The first digit from the right is ones, second is tens, third is hundreds, fourth is thousands. So, for 9999, the digits are: 9 (thousands), 9 (hundreds), 9 (tens), 9 (ones). So, the last two digits are both 9s, right? So, the last two digits are 99. Therefore, to check if 9999 is divisible by 4, we can check if 99 is divisible by 4.\n\nSo, let's divide 99 by 4. 4 times 24 is 96, which is less than 99. 4 times 25 is 100, which is more than 99. So, 99 divided by 4 is 24.75. So, since it's not an integer, 9999 is not divisible by 4.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to find the largest four-digit number less than 9999 that is divisible by 4. Since 9999 isn't divisible by 4, we need to subtract the remainder when divided by 4 to get the next lower number that is divisible by 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to find the largest number less than or equal to 9999 that is divisible by 4. Since 9999 is not, perhaps we can compute 9999 divided by 4, take the integer part, and then multiply back by 4 to get the nearest lower multiple.\n\nLet me try that. So, 9999 divided by 4. Let's compute this.\n\n4 goes into 9 two times (2*4=8), remainder 1. Bring down the next digit: 9. So, now it's 19. 4 goes into 19 four times (4*4=16), remainder 3. Bring down the next digit: 9. Now, it's 39. 4 goes into 39 nine times (9*4=36), remainder 3. Bring down the last digit: 9. Now, it's 39 again. 4 goes into 39 nine times, remainder 3. So, putting it all together, 9999 divided by 4 is 2499.75.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction here, the integer part is 2499. So, if we multiply 2499 by 4, we get 9996. Therefore, 9996 is the largest four-digit number divisible by 4.\n\nBut wait, let me verify that. 9996 divided by 4 is 2499. So yes, it is divisible by 4. And since we know that 9999 is not, subtracting 3 (since the remainder is 3) would give us 9996.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to find the largest four-digit number which is even because numbers divisible by 4 must be even. Wait, actually, yes, because if a number is divisible by 4, it's even, but just being even isn't enough. Wait, but actually, if a number is even, it can still not be divisible by 4. For example, 2 is even but not divisible by 4. So maybe that approach is more complicated.\n\nSo perhaps sticking with the first approach is better. Since 9999 isn't divisible by 4, subtract the remainder when divided by 4. Since 9999 divided by 4 is 2499.75, the remainder is 0.75*4=3. So, the remainder is 3. Therefore, subtract 3 from 9999 to get 9996.\n\nBut perhaps let's think again: another way is to subtract 1 from 9999 until we get a number that is divisible by 4. Let's see, but that might take longer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find the largest four-digit number less than or equal to 9999 that ends with a number divisible by 4. Since numbers divisible by 4 can end with 00, 04, 08, ..., up to 96. But perhaps the last two digits need to form a number that's divisible by 4.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to find the largest four-digit number, which is 9999, and then subtract the remainder when divided by 4.\n\nWait, perhaps let's compute 9999 modulo 4. Since 9999 divided by 4 is 2499.75, so 2499*4=9996, so 9999-9996=3. Therefore, 9999 mod 4 is 3. Therefore, to make it divisible by 4, we need to subtract 3. So, 9999-3=9996. Therefore, 9996 is the answer.\n\nBut perhaps let's test with another approach. Maybe starting from 9999 and subtracting 1 until we find a number divisible by 4.\n\nBut that might take too long, but perhaps let's see.\n\nCompute 9999-1=9998. Check if 9998 is divisible by 4.\n\nTo check if a number is divisible by 4, the last two digits must be divisible by 4. So, last two digits of 9998 are 98.\n\n98 divided by 4 is 24.5, which is not an integer. Therefore, 9998 is not divisible by 4.\n\nNext, subtract 1 again: 9997. Last two digits 97. 97/4=24.25, not integer.\n\nSubtract 1: 9996. Last two digits 96. 96/4=24, which is integer. Therefore, 9996 is divisible by 4.\n\nTherefore, 9996 is the number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the four-digit numbers. The largest four-digit number is 9999. The next lower number is 9998, but that's not divisible by 4. Then 9997, same thing. Then 9996, which is divisible.\n\nTherefore, 9996 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach: since the thousands digit is 9, the hundreds digit is also 9, the tens digit is 9, and the ones digit is 9. So, perhaps the number is 9999. Since we can't have that, perhaps we need to decrease it until the last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nAs above, we saw that 9999 is not, so subtract 3 to get 9996.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the last two digits. The last two digits of a number divisible by 4 must be even? No, actually, no. Because, for example, 100 is divisible by 4, but 100's last two digits are 00, which is even and divisible by 4. Similarly, 104 is divisible by 4, last two digits 04. But actually, numbers like 102 are not divisible by 4, since 02 is 2, which is not divisible by 4. Wait, actually, maybe not necessarily. Let's test.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. Since we know that any number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number that's divisible by 4. Therefore, perhaps the largest four-digit number is 9999. Let's find the largest number less than or equal to 9999 such that its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nSo, the last two digits can be from 9999's perspective: 9999 is the number. Let's take the last two digits as 99. As before, 99 divided by 4 is 24.75. So, not divisible.\n\nSo, perhaps to find the largest number less than or equal to 9999 such that the last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nSo, perhaps subtract the remainder when we divide the last two digits by 4.\n\nSince 99 divided by 4 is 24 with a remainder of 3. Therefore, 99 - 3 = 96, which is divisible by 4. Therefore, we can take the last two digits as 96, and then adjust the rest of the number accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting a bit convoluted. Maybe it's better to think that since 9999 is not divisible by 4, the next lower number is 9999 - (9999 mod 4). Since 9999 mod 4 is 3, as before, so subtract 3 to get 9996.\n\nTherefore, 9996 is the largest four-digit number divisible by 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to think about the number as 1000*a + 100*b +10*c +d, where a=9, b=9, c=9, d=9. Then, perhaps to adjust d such that the last two digits bc d are divisible by 4. Wait, perhaps this is overcomplicating.\n\nSo, perhaps I can think of the last two digits as the largest possible number less than or equal to 99 that is divisible by 4. Since the last two digits of the four-digit number can be from 00 to 99.\n\nTherefore, the largest number less than or equal to 99 that's divisible by 4. Well, 99 divided by 4 is 24.75, so the largest integer less than that is 24, so 24*4=96. Therefore, the last two digits should be 96. Therefore, the number would be 9996.\n\nTherefore, that seems consistent. Therefore, the largest four-digit number divisible by 4 is 9996.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking and verifying, I can conclude that the answer is 9996.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe largest four-digit number that is divisible by 4 is \\boxed{9996}.", "reference_answer": "9996", "verifier_score": 1.0, "id": 35024, "metadata": {"question_license": "MIT", "question_source": "Hendryks/MATH"}, "community_score": {"answer": null, "question": 0}}

So, we have the function f(x) = 3 / (2 - x). Then, we're told that g(x) is equal to 1 divided by the inverse function of f at x, plus 9. So, g(x) = 1 / f^{-1}(x) + 9. We need to find g(3).\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the inverse function of f(x), which is f^{-1}(x). Once I have that, I can plug x = 3 into g(x) to find g(3).\n\nSo, let's start by finding f^{-1}(x). Since f(x) is given as 3 divided by (2 - x), let's write it as f(x) = 3 / (2 - x). To find the inverse function, I need to solve for y in terms of x, where y = f(x). Then, swap x and y and solve again for y.\n\nSo, let me set y = f(x) = 3 / (2 - x).\n\nTo find the inverse, swap x and y:\n\nx = 3 / (2 - y)\n\nNow, solve for y.\n\nMultiply both sides by (2 - y):\n\nx(2 - y) = 3\n\nDistribute x:\n\n2x - x y = 3\n\nNow, let's collect terms with y:\n\n- x y = 3 - 2x\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nx y = 2x - 3\n\nNow, divide both sides by x:\n\ny = (2x - 3) / x\n\nSimplify:\n\ny = 2 - 3/x\n\nSo, the inverse function f^{-1}(x) is equal to 2 - 3/x.\n\nLet me double-check that step because sometimes when solving for inverses, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nGiven y = 3 / (2 - x).

The function g(x) is given as:\n\ng(x) = 1 / f^{-1}(x) + 9\n\nSo, let's write that:\n\ng(x) = 1 / [2 - 3/x] + 9\n\nNow, we need to compute g(3).

Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, f^{-1}(3) is 1.\n\nTherefore, plug this into g(x):\n\ng(3) = 1 / [f^{-1}(3)] + 9 = 1 / 1 + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10.\n\nWait, is that it? That seems straightforward, but let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to compute f^{-1}(x) first, then plug x=3 into g(x). But perhaps another way is to consider that g(x) is 1 / f^{-1}(x) + 9, so perhaps it's better to compute f^{-1}(x) first, then plug x into g.\n\nBut let me confirm:\n\nWe have f(x) = 3 / (2 - x). So, let's see if f^{-1}(x) is correctly computed.\n\nWe found f^{-1}(x) = 2 - 3/x.\n\nLet me test with an example: suppose f(a) = b. Then f^{-1}(b) should be a.\n\nLet's test with x = 1:\n\nf(1) = 3 / (2 - 1) = 3 /1 =3. Therefore, f^{-1}(3) should be 1. Using the inverse function f^{-1}(3) =2 - 3/3=2 -1=1. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, if x=0, but wait x can't be 2 since denominator would be zero. So, maybe take x= -1:\n\nf(-1) = 3 / (2 - (-1))=3 /3=1. Therefore, f^{-1}(1)=2 -3/1=2 -3=-1. Which matches.\n\nSo, seems correct.\n\nThus, f^{-1}(x)=2 - 3/x.\n\nTherefore, g(x)=1/[2 - 3/x] +9.\n\nTherefore, compute g(3):\n\nFirst, compute f^{-1}(3)=2 -3/3=2 -1=1.\n\nThus, plug into g(3)=1/1 +9=1+9=10.\n\nTherefore, g(3)=10.\n\nSo, the answer is 10.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe another way: perhaps compute f inverse at x=3, which is 1, then compute g(3)=1 /1 +9=10.\n\nAlternatively, let's think if perhaps they expect a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps first find f inverse function correctly.\n\nLet me re-express f(x)=3/(2 -x). Let me set y=3/(2 -x), solve for x.\n\nMultiply both sides by (2 -x):\n\ny(2 -x)=3\n\n2y - yx =3\n\nBring terms with x to one side:\n\n- yx=3 -2y\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nyx=2y -3\n\nThus, x=(2y -3)/y=2 -3/y.\n\nThus, f inverse is indeed f^{-1}(x)=2 -3/x.\n\nTherefore, correct.\n\nSo, g(x)=1/(2 -3/x)+9.\n\nCompute g(3):\n\nFirst compute f^{-1}(3)=2 -3/3=2-1=1.\n\nThus, g(3)=1/1 +9=10.\n\nHence, the answer is 10.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{10}", "reference_answer": "10", "verifier_score": 1.0, "id": 37622, "metadata": {"question_license": "MIT", "question_source": "Hendryks/MATH"}, "community_score": {"answer": null, "question": 0}}

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I should probably handle the denominator because it's a fraction itself. The denominator is 6 minus 2/5. So, maybe I should compute that first.\n\nLet me write it out: 6 - (2/5). Hmm, to subtract these, they need to have the same denominator. 6 is a whole number, so I can express it as a fraction over 5. That would be 6/1. So, to convert 6 into fifths, multiply numerator and denominator by 5. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to convert 6 to a fraction over 5. So, 6 is equal to 30/5 because 6 times 5 is 30, right? Wait, no, wait: Actually, if you have 6 minus something, it's better to write 6 as a fraction over 1, so to subtract 2/5, we need a common denominator.\n\nSo, 6 is the same as 6/1. To subtract 2/5, I need to express 6 as a fraction with denominator 5. So, multiply numerator and denominator by 5: (6 * 5)/(1 * 5) = 30/5. So, now, 6 is 30/5, so subtracting 2/5 gives: 30/5 - 2/5 = (30 - 2)/5 = 28/5.\n\nSo, the denominator simplifies to 28/5. Therefore, the original equation x = 35 / (28/5). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, 35 divided by (28/5) is equal to 35 multiplied by (5/28).\n\nNow, let's compute that. 35 times 5 is 175, and then divided by 28. So, x = 175 / 28.\n\nNow, let's simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 7. Let's check: 175 divided by 7 is 25, because 7*25=175. 28 divided by 7 is 4. So, now we have 25/4.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. Because 35 divided by (28/5) is same as 35*(5/28) = (35*5)/28. 35*5 is indeed 175, and 175 divided by 28. Let's see: 28*6=168, so 175-168=7, so it's 6 and 7/28, which simplifies to 6 and 1/4, or as an improper fraction, (6*4 +1)/4=25/4. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, x equals 25/4. Wait, let me just verify all steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with x = 35 / (6 - 2/5). First, compute the denominator: 6 - 2/5. Convert 6 to fifths: 6 is 30/5, so 30/5 - 2/5 is 28/5. Then, x = 35 / (28/5). Dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal: 35*(5/28). Simplify: 35 and 28 have a common factor of 7. 35 \u00f77=5, 28 \u00f77=4. Then, 5*5=25, and denominator is 4. So, x=25/4. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it differently. Let me compute 6 - 2/5 first as decimal to check. 6 is 6.0, and 2/5 is 0.4. So, 6.0 - 0.4 is 5.6. Then, compute 35 divided by 5.6. Let me compute that. 5.6 times 6 is 33.6, because 5.6*5=28, 5.6*1=5.6; 28+5.6=33.6. Then, 35-33.6=1.4. So, 5.6*6=33.6, remainder 1.4. Now, 1.4 /5.6 is equal to 0.25 because 5.6*0.25=1.4. Therefore, 35 /5.6=6 +0.25=6.25. Now, 6.25 is equal to 25/4 because 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So, yes, that also gives the same result. So, that confirms that x=25/4 is correct.\n\nTherefore, after all these steps, I can confidently say that x is equal to 25/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{4}}.", "reference_answer": "\\frac{25}{4}", "verifier_score": 1.0, "id": 38543, "metadata": {"question_license": "MIT", "question_source": "Hendryks/MATH"}, "community_score": {"answer": null, "question": 0}}

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. That usually works. So maybe I can start by adding 2x to both sides to get rid of the -2x on the left. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting with -2x -7 = 7x + 2. If I add 2x to both sides, that would give me:\n\n(-2x + 2x) -7 = 7x + 2x + 2.\n\nSimplifying that, on the left side, -2x + 2x is 0x, so just -7. On the right side, 7x + 2x is 9x, so it becomes 9x + 2. So now the equation is:\n\n-7 = 9x + 2.\n\nOkay, that seems better. Now, maybe I should get rid of that +2 on the right side. So perhaps subtract 2 from both sides?\n\nLet me try that. Subtracting 2 from both sides:\n\n-7 - 2 = 9x + 2 - 2.\n\nSimplifying that, on the left, -7 -2 is -9. On the right, 2 -2 cancels out, so just 9x. So now the equation is:\n\n-9 = 9x.\n\nHmm, okay. So now, to solve for x, I need to get x by itself. Since x is being multiplied by 9, I can divide both sides by 9.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by 9:\n\n-9 / 9 = 9x / 9.\n\nSimplifying that, the left side is -1. The right side is x. So, x = -1.\n\nWait, let me check if that's correct.

That's 2 -7, which is -5.\n\nRight side: 7*(-1) + 2. That's -7 + 2, which is also -5.\n\nOkay, so both sides are equal to -5 when x is -1.
